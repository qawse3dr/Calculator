Made using android studio 2 in 2017
basic formating.
  * must be used for mutiplication ie 5*(10) not 5(10)
  log must have brackets around it ie log(10)
    or can use different bases by adding number before brackets ie log2(2) = 1
  if degree button is shown it means you are in radians and vis versa
